# 📚 Topic: Arrays

## 📝 Description
Arrays are a collection of elements stored at contiguous memory locations. They are the most basic data structure and a foundation for many complex ones. Arrays allow random access and are used for storing data elements of the same type.

## Key Concepts
- Index-based access
- Fixed size (in most languages)
- Time Complexity:
  - Access: O(1)
  - Insertion/Deletion: O(n) (in worst case)
